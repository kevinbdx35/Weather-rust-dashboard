## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 2021 edition or later
- Cargo package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd weather-telemetry
```

2. Build and run the application:
```bash
cargo run
```

The application will start with simulated weather data for demonstration purposes.

### Development Build

For development with debug information:
```bash
cargo build
./target/debug/weather-telemetry
```

### Production Build

For optimized production build:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/weather-telemetry
```

## Build Status

‚úÖ **Successfully Compiled**: The project compiles without errors  
‚úÖ **Runtime Tested**: Application launches and displays the weather dashboard  
‚úÖ **Real-time Data**: Weather data streams are functional  
‚úÖ **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with professional design

## Configuration

### Data Collection

The telemetry system supports both simulated and real data sources:

- **Simulated Mode**: Generates realistic weather data for demonstration
- **Real Data Integration**: Modify `telemetry.rs` to connect to actual weather sensors

### UI Customization

- **Time Ranges**: Choose from 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, or 7 days
- **Chart Display**: Toggle individual charts or view all metrics in grid layout
- **Card Layout**: Responsive weather cards showing current conditions
- **Statistics Panel**: Comprehensive statistics with min/max/average values

## Data Structures

### Weather Data
```rust
pub struct WeatherData {
    pub temperature: f32,      // ¬∞C
    pub humidity: f32,         // %
    pub pressure: f32,         // hPa
    pub wind_speed: f32,       // m/s
    pub wind_direction: f32,   // degrees
    pub rain_rate: f32,        // mm/h
    pub uv_index: f32,         // UV index
    pub solar_radiation: f32,  // W/m¬≤
}
```
